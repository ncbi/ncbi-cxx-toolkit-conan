## What is Conan and why you might need it?

[Conan](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/) is an Open Source package manager for C and C++ development, 
allowing development teams to easily and efficiently
manage their packages and dependencies across platforms and build systems. Conan can manage any number of different 
binaries for different build configurations, including different architectures, compilers, compiler versions, runtimes, 
C++ standard library, etc. When binaries are not available for one configuration, they can be built from sources on-demand.

When using NCBI C++ Toolkit at NCBI, there is good chance you do not need Conan. 
Different versions of Toolkit libraries and applications are readily available, as well as a long list of third party libraries. 
Still, there is always a chance you need something special. Conan might be the answer.

Using NCBI C++ Toolkit outside of NCBI is much more tricky. You need to download and build certain third party libraries, 
then the Toolkit itself. It is not always clear what exactly is required. Conan's help might be very useful in this scenario.


<a name="recipe_Env"></a>
## Preparing work environment.

First, you need Conan (and, to install Conan, you need Python). For instructions of how to install Conan, please refer to [Conan's documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html). Note that Conan evolves, recipes change. As of March 2023, you need at least version 1.53.

On February 22, 2023 Conan 2.0 was released. It is a major upgrade, which features new public API, new build system integration and new graph model to represent relations between packages. The Toolkit recipe is fully compatible both with Conan 1.X and 2.0.

Install Conan v1.61.0:

    pip install conan==1.61.0

If needed, upgrade Conan installation:

    pip install conan --upgrade

Next, check the list of Conan repositories and add *center.conan.io*:

    $ conan remote add conan-center https://center.conan.io
    $ conan remote list
    conan-center: https://center.conan.io [Verify SSL: True]

Make sure *cmake* is found in *PATH*. On MacOS and Windows this might require correcting the *PATH* environment variable.
Finally. NCBI C++ Toolkit is large. Building it locally requires a lot of disk space. By default, Conan's local cache is located 
in user home directory, which, most likely does not have enough space. To place Conan's cache into another location, 
you should define [CONAN_USER_HOME](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/env_vars.html) environment variable. In Conan 2.0, one can define [CONAN_HOME](https://docs.conan.io/2/reference/environment.html) instead. Note that its meaning is different.

Check the list of Conan [profiles](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/misc/profile.html). Create *default* one:

    conan profile list
    conan profile new default --detect
    conan profile show default

When using GCC on Linux, check profile and specify that [new ABI should be used](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/howtos/manage_gcc_abi.html)

    conan profile update settings.compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 default
    conan profile show default

Clone this repository and export the recipe into the local Conan cache:

    git clone https://github.com/ncbi/ncbi-cxx-toolkit-conan.git
    cd ncbi-cxx-toolkit-conan
    conan export . 28.0.0@_/_

NCBI C++ Toolkit versions:

- 0.0.0  - most recent source code from [GitHub/master](https://github.com/ncbi/ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public)
- 27.0.0 - The Toolkit v27.0.0 from [GitHub](https://github.com/ncbi/ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public/releases/tag/release-27.0.0)
- 28.0.0 - The Toolkit v28.0.0 from [GitHub](https://github.com/ncbi/ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public/releases/tag/release-28.0.0)


<a name="recipe_Build"></a>
## Building your project.

Let us build [blast_demo](https://github.com/ncbi/ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public/blob/master/src/sample/app/blast/CMakeLists.blast_demo.app.txt) sample application. It requires one source file and some unknown number of the Toolkit libraries. 
What we know for sure is that we need *blastinput* library.

Copy *blast_demo.cpp* into a local directory. Next to it, create *conanfile.txt*:

    [requires]
    ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public/28.0.0
    [options]
    ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public:with_targets=blastinput
    [generators]
    cmake_find_package


and *CMakeLists.txt*:

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
    project(conanapp)
    set(ncbitk ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public)
    set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR})
    find_package(${ncbitk} REQUIRED)
    add_executable(blast_demo blast_demo.cpp)
    target_link_libraries(blast_demo ${ncbitk}::${ncbitk})


Create build directory and install build requirements:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    conan install .. --build missing


[Configure](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#generate-a-project-buildsystem) and
[build](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#build-a-project):

    cmake ..
    cmake --build .

Or, on Windows:

    cmake ..
    cmake --build . --config Release


<a name="recipe_Options"></a>
## Define build options.

NCBI C++ Toolkit libraries can be built as either shared or static ones. The same applies to external packages. 
You can request desired options in conanfile.txt. For example, the following instructs Conan to use NCBI C++ Toolkit 
shared libraries:

    [requires]
    ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public/28.0.0
    [options]
    ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public:with_targets=blastinput
    ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public:shared=True
    [generators]
    cmake_find_package


To switch between Debug and Release build types, you can use command line when installing Conan dependencies:

    conan install .. -s build_type=Debug --build missing
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug


<a name="recipe_Other"></a>
## Supported 3rd party packages.

The Toolkit uses a number of 3-rd party packages. The following is the list of packages supported by *ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public* 
Conan recipe (as of March 2023):

    BACKWARD, BerkeleyDB, BZ2, GIF, GRPC, JPEG, LMDB, LZO, NGHTTP2,
    PCRE, PNG, PROTOBUF, SQLITE3, TIFF, XML, XSLT, UV, UNWIND, Z, ZSTD


<a name="recipe_Notes"></a>
## There are few things to note.

The whole Toolkit contains about 250 libraries. You probably do not need all of them. That is why it is 
recommended that you specify what exactly you need in options section of conanfile.txt. It is possible to list 
several libraries here using semicolon separator:

    [options]
    ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public:with_targets=blastinput;xncbi;xser


You do not need to know all the dependencies. They will be collected automatically. For example, in case of *blastinput* 
library Conan will build and use 58 ones.

*CONAN_LIBS* macro collects all libraries into one blob. That is, if you do not specify *ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public:with_targets*, 
all 250 toolkit libraries, as well as all external ones will be in that blob. This might work. The linker will figure out 
what exactly it needs, but it definitely will be overwhelmed. Also, it takes more time to build libraries which you do not really need.


<a name="recipe_Serial"></a>
## Data serialization support.

### Datatool.

The Toolkit contains [datatool](https://ncbi.github.io/cxx-toolkit/pages/ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool) application, which can generate C++ data storage classes from ASN.1, DTD, XML schema or JSON schema specification. These classes can then be used to [read and write data](https://ncbi.github.io/cxx-toolkit/pages/ch_ser) in ASN.1, XML or JSON format.
To add code generation into a project, use *NCBI_generate_cpp* command. For example:

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
    project(conanapp)
    set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR})
    find_package(ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public REQUIRED)
    NCBI_generate_cpp(GEN_SOURCES GEN_HEADERS sample.asn)
    add_executable(asn_demo asn_demo.cpp ${GEN_SOURCES} ${GEN_HEADERS})
    target_link_libraries(asn_demo xser)

First two parameters to *NCBI_generate_cpp* receive lists of generated files - sources and headers. After that goes one or more data specifications. Files will be generated during the build in the directory where the specification is.

### Protocol buffers and gRPC.

[gRPC](https://grpc.io) is an open source high performance Remote Procedure Call framework. By default, gRPC uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview), Googleâ€™s open source mechanism for serializing structured data.

First, make sure your project contains proper requirements. For example, conanfile.txt can request *protobuf* and *grpc*:

    [requires]
    ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public/28.0.0
    protobuf/3.21.4
    grpc/1.50.1

Next, you can use their own mechanisms, or the same NCBI function *NCBI_generate_cpp*:

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
    project(conanapp)
    set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR})
    find_package(ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public REQUIRED)
    NCBI_generate_cpp(GEN_SOURCES GEN_HEADERS sample.proto)
    add_library(grpc_demo grpc_demo.cpp ${GEN_SOURCES} ${GEN_HEADERS})
    
By default, *NCBI_generate_cpp* generates *protocol buffers* files only. To instruct it to generate gRPC ones as well, use *GEN_OPTIONS* flags, like this:

    NCBI_generate_cpp(GEN_SOURCES GEN_HEADERS sample.proto GEN_OPTIONS grpc)


<a name="recipe_NCBIptb"></a>
## NCBI build process management.

NCBI C++ Toolkit includes [NCBIptb](https://ncbi.github.io/cxx-toolkit/pages/ch_cmconfig) - CMake wrapper, which can also be used with Conan.

For example, *CMakeLists.txt* for [blast_demo](#recipe_Build) project might as well look like the following:

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
    project(conanapp)
    set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR})
    find_package(ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public REQUIRED)
    NCBIptb_setup()

    NCBI_begin_app(blast_demo)
      NCBI_sources(blast_demo)
      NCBI_uses_toolkit_libraries(blastinput)
    NCBI_end_app()

Note that *NCBIptb* expects source tree root to have *include* and *src* subdirectories:

    - root
        - include
            - ...
        - src
            - ...

All header files are then expected to be in *include* and its subdirectories; sources - in *src*.

In other words, your root *CMakeLists.txt* should look like this:

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
    project(conanapp)
    set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR})
    find_package(ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public REQUIRED)
    NCBIptb_setup()
    NCBI_add_subdirectory(src)

The *blast_demo* example above will also work, of course. But as long as you add more and more projects, it is practically imperative that you adopt the standard NCBIptb source tree structure.

In case of data serialization projects, you should follow the standard *NCBIptb* practice - use *NCBI_dataspecs* function call. For example:

    NCBI_begin_lib(asn_sample_lib)
      NCBI_dataspecs(asn_sample_lib.asn)
      NCBI_uses_toolkit_libraries(xser)
    NCBI_end_lib()
